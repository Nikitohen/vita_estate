vita_estate

This repository shows my skills on HTML and CSS based on the wireframe provided from the friend who has made it herself.

1.Project Title:
Vita Estate Real Estate Website

2.Description:
To foster my skills further in HTML and CSS I have had an opportunity to take an existing wireframe and build a page based on it.
Unfortunately there were no responsive versions of wireframe provided, so I had to improvise.

3.Features:
This project is somewhat of advanced for element positioning, nevertheless the style of web page is no longer in general use today.

4.How to use:
The web page is navigated like any ordinary page. No JavaScript has been implemented yet, though there is room for future improvement.

5.Technologies:
HTML, CSS.

6.Collaborators:
The design was provided from friend who is willing to be anonymous. To credit her skills it is worth mentioning that she had went to 
digital design of business leaflets, cards and brand identity course.

8.License:
This project doesnâ€™t have any license.
